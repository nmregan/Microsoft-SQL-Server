# SQL-Server
SQL was my first database language and my first course in school.  In this course I learned how to design and interact with a database.
I learned the rules of normalization, SQL basics like SELECTS, UPDATES, DELETES and JOINS, as well as how to create relationships and foreign keys.  In my second semester I learned how to use Stored Procedures, Views, Aggregates, Unions, and much more.
